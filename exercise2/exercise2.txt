# IPS-Req Summary
1. Template for a System Security & Privacy Plan (SSPP) for Identity Protection Services (IPS) under GSA SIN 541990IPS; tailored for FIPS 199 **Moderate** systems (May 2024).
2. Purpose: document security control implementations, system purpose/operations, component inventories, data flows, architecture, and authorization boundary.
3. Approvals required to finalize the SSPP: **System Owner, GSA ISSO, Vendor ISSO (if applicable), and GSA ISSM**.
4. Uses the latest GSA OCISO SSPP template; System Owner/ISSO must ensure all technologies are fully described across Sections 1–12.
5. Mandatory preparatory artifacts: **Privacy Threshold Assessment/PIA**, **FIPS 199 Security Categorization**, **Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (DIAS per NIST 800-63)**, and **Security Architecture Review (CIO-IT 19-95)**.
6. **ATO showstoppers** that must be fully satisfied: MFA for privileged & user accounts; remediation of critical/high vulns; remediation of **RCE** vulns; avoidance/justification of **End-of-Life software**; **architecture review**; **encrypt sensitive data everywhere**; and **integration with GSA’s security stack**.
7. OCISO reviews SSPP for completeness/consistency per **GSA IT Security Procedural Guide 06-30**; may require updates before approval.
8. Section 1–8 collect system identifiers, owners, AO, designated contacts, security roles, lifecycle status, and whether the system is a Major Information System/minor subsystem.
9. System categorization records information types and CIA impact levels; DIAS table captures IAL/AAL/FAL selections.
10. Sections 8.1–8.2 capture **inherited** and **provided** controls among interconnected systems (common vs. hybrid).
11. Section 9 demands a full **general system description**, including locations, components/boundary, URLs (with MFA method), user types/roles, and a network architecture description.
12. User-roles table must state internal/external status, privilege level, sensitivity level, functions, and **MFA method**; privileged/non-privileged access flows must be described.
13. Network diagram must clearly show the **authorization boundary**, enclaves/subnets/DMZs, access control mechanisms, and traffic characteristics.
14. Section 10 (**System Environment**) requires documenting production/test/staging, hardened software stack, and **key management** aligned with BCP/DR/COOP expectations.
15. **Encrypt sensitive data (PII/PCI/authenticators) everywhere**—file, DB, at rest, and in transit; prefer end-to-end TLS terminating at the web server; re-encrypt after load balancers.
16. Cryptography must be **FIPS-approved** modules; use HTTPS/HSTS and modern TLS; follow DHS **BOD 18-01** for web/email security.
17. Section 10.1–10.6: maintain **asset inventory**, catalog **external services**, **software inventory**, **data flows**, **data nature**, and a **ports/protocols/services** matrix including encryption and sensitivity.
18. Section 10.7: include a plan to transition to **IPv6** per **OMB M-21-07** and GSA policy.
19. Section 10.8 (**DevOps/DevSecOps**): specify **VCS/branching**, **IAC** with CI/CD checks, **pipeline isolation**, **code scanning**, **dependency scanning**, **image mgmt**, **secret/key mgmt**, **artifact mgmt**, **release mgmt**, and **serverless** design if used.
20. Section 10.9 (**Containers**): detail image build/registry/scanning, logging, **hardening** (CIS), **RBAC & least privilege** (non-root), **network segmentation/policies**, orchestration (ECS/EKS/K8s/Fargate), and **monitoring/alerting**.
21. Section 10.10 (**AWS Management**): list services with FedRAMP/OCISO approval; describe **federation/IAM & MFA**, **separation of workloads** (multi-account), **HA network design**, **micro-segmentation**, **encryption in transit & at rest**, and related governance/monitoring.
22. Interconnections must record security (e.g., IPSec/TLS), data direction, data type, and ports/circuits; reference ISAs/MOUs as needed.
23. Section 13 (**Minimum Security Controls**) provides implementation guidance aligned to GSA-defined parameters, least-permissive network access, and CA-7 continuous monitoring alignment with CIO-IT 08-39/12-66.
24. Control-writing guidance: mark **Planned/Not Applicable** with justification, tie to **POA\&M**; explain **hybrid/common** control origination; structure responses by **asset type**, **authN/authZ method**, and **common** controls.
25. Appendices & attachments include: **Acronyms/Terms**, **References** (NIST/FIPS/CIO guides), and required attachments (PTA/PIA, FIPS 199, DIAS, ISA, CTW, control summary, Contingency/IR plans & test reports, CM Plan, ConMon Plan, Rules of Behavior, Code Review Report).

# NIST-Req Summary
1. SP 800-172 supplements SP 800-171 with enhanced controls to protect CUI against advanced persistent threats (APTs), covering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
2. Applicability is agency-mandated; it targets nonfederal components and services that handle CUI for critical programs or high-value assets.
3. Emphasizes defense-in-depth via three strategies: Penetration-Resistant Architecture, Damage-Limiting Operations, and Cyber Resilience/Survivability.
4. Requirements are explicitly threat-centric and designed to counter APT tradecraft.
5. Strong focus on segmentation and isolation (e.g., subnets, VMs, containers, enclaves) to limit blast radius.
6. Dual authorization is required for the most sensitive operations.
7. Persistent storage of CUI should be restricted to isolated enclaves/domains.
8. Enforce comply-to-connect: only known, authenticated, and properly configured components may connect.
9. Strengthen configuration management with authoritative baselines, automated detection/quarantine of misconfigurations and unauthorized components, and accurate inventories.
10. Periodically refresh or restore systems/components to a known-good state.
11. Operate a SOC with advanced analytics and automation for continuous monitoring and rapid response.
12. Use cyber deception to mislead, detect, and expose adversaries.
13. Enhanced requirements span 14 control families; there are no additional enhancements for Audit & Accountability, Maintenance, Media Protection, or Physical Protection.
14. Parameterization (assignment/selection statements) is set by the cognizant federal agency in coordination with the contractor.
15. Agencies select only the necessary enhancements based on mission risk and may target specific components, including those on attack paths.
16. Scope can be reduced by isolating CUI into a separate security domain with controlled information flow.
17. AC 3.1.2e: restrict access to organization-owned/provisioned resources (limiting BYOD).
18. AC 3.1.3e: employ secure information-transfer solutions (mutual authentication, encryption, isolation, transfer logging, cross-domain solutions).
19. AT 3.2: provide threat-focused training and realistic exercises with feedback; keep content current.
20. IA 3.5: require cryptographic, replay-resistant, bidirectional device/user authentication; manage passwords where MFA isn’t feasible; block unknown devices.
21. IR 3.6: maintain a deployable incident response capability integrated with the SOC for forensics, quarantine, and recovery.
22. PS 3.9: conduct enhanced personnel screening and act on adverse information (limit access, increase auditing).
23. RA 3.11: integrate threat intelligence, perform threat hunting, and use predictive analytics/automation; document solutions and periodically assess effectiveness.
24. Appendix C maps enhancements to NIST SP 800-53 and aligns with the NIST CSF (informative mappings, not extra requirements).
25. Appendix D’s adversary-effects model aims to redirect, preclude, impede, limit, and expose adversaries to reduce likelihood and impact.

# PCI-Req Summary
1. Purpose: practical, risk-reduction guidance for merchants using consumer mobile devices to accept card payments; it does **not** replace PCI DSS requirements.
2. Scope: “Category 3, Scenario 2” — apps running on non-dedicated consumer devices that can access clear-text data and are **not** PCI PTS-eligible.
3. Alternative: merchants unable to meet guidance should consider a validated PCI P2PE solution with an approved POI device.
4. Excludes BYOD: employee-owned devices are **not** recommended because the merchant can’t control configuration/security.
5. Core risks addressed: account data entering the device, residing on the device, and leaving the device.
6. Objective 1: prevent interception during entry (e.g., use PTS-approved PIN entry, verify device/app versions, deter shoulder-surfing).
7. Objective 2: prevent compromise in processing/storage (limit access, secure placement/storage, secure local networks like Wi-Fi/Bluetooth per PCI DSS 4).
8. Objective 3: protect transmissions (change defaults; use strong wireless encryption/authentication; never store clear-text PAN on Internet-connected servers).
9. Device security—physical: lock/tether devices; secure storage when not in use; reduce public access.
10. Device security—logical access: restrict to authorized users; prefer multi-user OS support; require strong auth (biometrics/password/MFA); enable full-disk encryption.
11. Malware defenses: install/update anti-malware (when available); use MDM/MAM and application wrapping; install only trusted software; never root/jailbreak.
12. Secure state: baseline/regular scans (excessive privileges, clear-text storage, MITM risks); show “secure state” indicator; enforce no USB debugging/untrusted sources.
13. Root/jailbreak detection: monitor continuously (including offline); auto-quarantine devices or remove payment app if detected.
14. Logging/monitoring: enable near-real-time logging for device and payment app; review alerts and investigate anomalies before resuming transactions.
15. New/factory devices preferred; avoid devices with unknown history/provenance.
16. Minimize attack surface: disable unnecessary radios/features not required by the solution.
17. Loss/theft readiness: record serial/model/OS/app versions; uniquely mark devices; keep usage logs (who/when/where).
18. Incident response: detect/report quickly; remotely disable and securely wipe lost/stolen devices (often via the solution provider).
19. End-of-life: consistently sanitize and dispose; remove tags/branding; use authorized e-waste vendors—don’t dumpster devices.
20. Solution security: choose providers that meet relevant requirements; follow acquirer/provider guidance; train staff with provided materials.
21. Prefer online auth only: avoid offline authorization or “store-and-forward” for later transmission.
22. Access control lifecycle: ability to grant/change/revoke payment-app access; keep records of authorized users/devices.
23. Customer assurance: give cardholders a way to verify merchant legitimacy (IDs, acceptance marks, serials, public registries).
24. Receipts: mask PAN; never send PAN/SAD via insecure channels (e-mail/SMS).
25. Residual/appendix risks: fragmented supply chain and lack of device validation, jurisdictional constraints (e.g., remote wipe), physical/data access paths, zero-day markets, insider backdoors, device variation, limited role-based controls, and resource limits for anti-malware—requiring ongoing vigilance.
