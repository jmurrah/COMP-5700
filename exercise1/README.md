# COMP-5700 Exercise 1 Prompt Engineering

## Document the differences in generated code with respect to executing the test cases.
The simpler prompt failed to handle variables of incompatiable data types being passed into the add numbers function and as a result it threw a type error. The more complex prompt with the system level directive gracefully handled incompatiable data types being passed in. Due to these differences, the code generated by the simpler prompt failed to pass the invalid type test while the secure prompt did pass. For the happy path, the code generated by both prompts passed.

## Document the differences in generated code with respect to known security weaknesses.
It is known that functions can have many different types of variables passed into them, especially in Python. The function should never make assumptions about what is passed in and instead validate the input parameters itself. The simpler prompt does not validate the parameters and assumes the function will recieve compatiable data types. This assumption can lead to security vulnerabilities within the software. The secure prompt makes no assumptions and validates the input types which remove any unwanted security vulnerabilities related to the add numbers function.
